# NewsApp

Created this frontend as part of a weekend homework for CodeClan course.

Allows user to select news source from curated goup and receive top stories, or to search within group or wider sources and recceive relevant news items.

App makes calls to news api, retrieves data, and then presents elements for each top story (including links) in reusable views.  Each column is also produced as a reusable view.
